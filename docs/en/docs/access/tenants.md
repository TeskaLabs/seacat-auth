# Tenants

A tenant is one entity with its own set of data. Each tenant is an isolated space, like tenants in an apartment building or block of flats. Every tenant's data is completely separated from all other tenants' data in the UI. One tenant can be accessible by multiple users, and users can have access to multiple tenants.

You can control which users can access which tenants by assigning credentials to tentants or vice-versa.

On the Tenants screen, you can see:

* Tenant names
* Date the tenant was created

## Creating a tenant

1. Click **New tenant** on the Tenants page.
2. Enter the name of the tenant.
3. Click **Create a tenant**.

## Adding credentials to a tenant

1. From the Tenants page, click on the tenant.
2. Click **Assign credentials**, and select credentials from the dropdown list.
