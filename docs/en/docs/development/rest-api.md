# REST API

The ASAB framework that Seacat Auth is built on provides an OpenAPI specs endpoint with Swagger UI 
(read more in [ASAB documentation](https://docs.teskalabs.com/asab/)).

Swagger UI is available at the `/doc` path.

OpenAPI specs are available at `/asab/v1/openapi`.

## Postman

To explore the Seacat API with Postman, you can download the OpenAPI specs from `/asab/v1/openapi` as a file
and [import it into Postman as a new collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/integrations/available-integrations/working-with-openAPI/).
