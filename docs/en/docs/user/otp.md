# Adding an OTP (one-time PIN) authenticator

If you want an extra layer of security ([multi-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication)), you can add a [one-time PIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password) generator, such as an authenticator app, to your account. When you have an authenticator app active, you'll need to enter a one-time PIN **and** your password every time you log in (unless you also have a [hardware key](./hardware-keys.md) active, in which case you can choose upon logging in).

## Adding an OTP authenticator

1. Choose an OTP authenticator app.
2. Go to **My account** > **Manage**.
3. Click **Manage One-Time PIN (OTP)**.
4. Scan the QR code with your authenticator app.
5. Enter the code that your authenticator app provides, and click **OK** to confirm.
6. Click **Activate OTP**.
7. As long as you have an OTP authenticator active, you need your password **and** a one-time PIN to log in.

## Removing an OTP authenticator

1. Go to **My account** > **Manage**.
2. Click **Manage One-Time PIN (OTP)**.
3. Click **Deactivate OTP**, and click **OK** to confirm.
4. Now, you no longer need an OTP to log in.
