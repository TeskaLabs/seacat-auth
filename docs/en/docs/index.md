# About TeskaLabs SeaCat Auth

_TeskaLabs SeaCat Auth_ is a [microservice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices) that provides authentication, authorization, identity management, session management, [and other features](./reference/features.md). It is designed to be used as an access control and/or single sign-on (SSO) solution for other microservices and [applications](./integrations).

Seacat Auth implements [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2), a widely supported authorization protocol, which makes it compatible with many applications. Seacat Auth also provides tools that make integrating non-OAuth applications into an OAuth ecosystem easy.

Seacat Auth also functions as [OpenID Connect](https://auth0.com/docs/authenticate/protocols/openid-connect-protocol) provider, offering useful features such as single sign-on (SSO) and authentication using JSON web tokens (JWTs).
