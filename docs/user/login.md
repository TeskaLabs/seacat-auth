# Login

The SeaCat Auth login portal allows you to log in, start over, and retrieve password help.

## Logging in

To log in, enter your login credentials: username, phone number, or email, and password.

You can add an [OTP authenticator](./otp.md) or a [hardware key](./hardware-keys.md) for additional login security.
