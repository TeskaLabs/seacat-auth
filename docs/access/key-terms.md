# Key terms

## Credentials

Credentials are users. Credentials are represented by user names and can include an email address and phone number as supplemental information. You can assign tenants and roles to credentials, as well as manage credentials' sessions.

## Tenant

A tenant is one entity with its own set of data. Each tenant is an isolated space, like tenants in an apartment building or block of flats. Every tenant's data is completely separated from all other tenants' data in the UI.

One tenant can be accessible by multiple users, and users can have access to multiple tenants. You can control which users can access which tenants by assigning credentials to tentants or vice-versa.

## Resource

Resources are the most basic unit of authorization. They are single and specific access permissions.

Examples:

* Permission to access a specifc page
* Permission to delete a specific type of item
* Permission to make changes to a group of files

## Role

A role is a container for resources. Since resources are single permissions, a role is a set of permissions. You can add any number and combination of resources to a role.

## Client

Clients are additional applications and services that are accessing the app.

## Session

A session is an active login period.
