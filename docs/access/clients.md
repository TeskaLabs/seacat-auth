# Clients

A client is an entity that uses authentication and authorization services provided by the authorization server. 
This authorization enables the client to access protected resources. In other words, clients are additional apps connected to SeaCat Auth.

See the [Clients](../reference/clients.md) reference page for more technical details.

* **Client ID**: A non-editable, unique, automatically generated ID. (More [here](../reference/clients.md#client_id).)
