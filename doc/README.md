# Authentication and authorization interface

**`IMPORTANT`** The complete SeaCat Auth authentication and authorization interface is provided by `/public/...` and `/openidconnect/...` endpoints.
It is crucial that only these paths are used by third party applications and only these paths can be accessed from public.

_TODO: Describe proper authentication flow with example `/openidconnect/authorize` calls_
